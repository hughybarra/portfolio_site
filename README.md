#Portfolio Site

This is my portfolio site. Um... dunno what else to say at the moment Ill edit this doc later


Ran into a strange html link error. My links work just fine in the test environment. When I push the site live all of the links are breaking and i'm getting this error in console.

Refused to display 'https://www.facebook.com/hugo.ybarra' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'DENY'.

I was able to fix this by adding this attribute target="_blank" to all of my links
